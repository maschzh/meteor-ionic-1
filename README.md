# Ionic for Meteor

[Ionic](http://ionicframework.com) is the open source HTML5 Mobile Framework for building amazing, cross-platform hybrid native apps with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

This package enables the Ionic Framework to work on [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/).

It is best supported with used in combination with the [angular-meteor library](http://angularjs.meteor.com/).
